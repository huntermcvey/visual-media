     <h1>My opinion</h1>
     <p>I was debating whether or not to step outside my comfort zone and enroll in this course. We discuss topics that I previously had not put any thought into, and it's been a good experience. The class is online, so all the responsibility falls on the student. The first couple weeks I did not stay updated and missed a few discussions, but I quickly figured out what needed to be done to be succesful in the course. Professor Nelson set up the online course in a very professional manor, and makes sure all the students know what is expected with online etiqutte.   </p>

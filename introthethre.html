     <h1> Class description </h1>
     <p>  This course is designed as an introduction to the theatre as a living, collaborative art form. Through our reading (or viewing) and discussion of representative plays, we explore each text within its unique historical, social and cultural context; and discover the visions, processes and methodologies utilized by theatre artists to bring the theatre to life. </p>

     <h1>My opinion</h1>
     <p> Professor Rinehart has a pretty big responsibility teaching more than 500 students every semester. Along with teaching, she also has acted in and directed numerous productions here at Virginia Tech. When you are attending one of her lectures it is quite obvious how passionate she really is about her work. It really makes a difference when learning new information to have someone so knowledgeable about the work. I previously did not really have an interest in theatre, but this course has opened my mind to new things and got me out of my comfort zone.</p>
